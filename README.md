# Textstepper

Textstepper is a simple tool to go through a text one word at a time.
I found this helpful for proof reading.

## Usage

Paste your text into the textfield and press the start button.
Navigate forth or back via arrow keys or by clicking the right or left part of the screen.
Use "Esc" or the "X" button to go back to the main page.
